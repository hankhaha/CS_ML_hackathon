       " \"Protect Your System: Some suspicious emails contain attachments and link to websites that try to install malicious software on your computer. To increase the security of your account, we recommend enabling Two-Step Verification. When connecting from an unknown device, you need to enter a unique security code in addition to your password. For more information, see [Enable Two-Step Verification](www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GE6SLZ5J9GCNRW44). Here are some tips to protect your account: If you've entered your password on what you think might be a malicious website, go to [Password Assistance](www.amazon.com/gp/css/account/forgot-password/email.html) and change it immediately. If you've entered your payment information on what you think might be a malicious website or replied to an email with that information, immediately contact your financial institution. Note: Remember to update this payment method on your Amazon account afterwards. For additional account security tips, here are some ways to protect your system, devices, and wireless network: Install anti-virus or antimalware software. Keep security software up to date by installing updates and patches as soon as they're available. Note: When the installation is complete, run a full scan of your computer. Keep your operating system and necessary plugins updated to the latest version available. Never reply to unsolicited messages. Replying to phishing and spam messages only notifies the sender that they have a valid email address to which they can send more spam and phishing messages. Note: If you want to unsubscribe from Amazon communications, do so directly through our website instead of clicking a link in an email. Never place an order by email with a seller. These requests are often intended to collect email addresses to launch a phishing or spam campaign. If you receive an email asking you to pay for an order by bank transfer, ignore this request and contact us. Only install software you need and that comes from verified sources. Ignore urgent pop-ups that tell you your devices are infected with a virus and that you must click a link to fix the problem. Don't leave your devices unattended in public places. Select the option to manually, not automatically, connect to WiFi. Disable hotspots when not needed. Change the name of your wireless network and any preset passwords provided by the vendor, even if the name and password seem complex. If you receive a suspicious or fraudulent correspondence claiming to be from Amazon, we recommend that you report it immediately.

To remove an authorization, contact your bank to clarify how long they hold authorizations for online orders.

       " 'A First-Time Romance Author Earns Over $1,100/Month in 3 Weeks\\n\\nSo, my sister had uploaded her book to Amazon one afternoon. She wasn’t expecting much in the way of sales. But to her surprise, when she logged into her Amazon publisher’s account the next morning, she had sold a dozen copies or so. And, throughout the day, the sales kept coming.\\n\\nDuring the first three weeks, she sold 541 copies of this “little romance that could,” earning her over $1,100. For those who don’t know, Amazon pays authors 70 percent of all novels priced between $2.99 and $9.99. So you net about $2.09 on a novel priced at $2.99, which is where she priced hers.\\n\\nAs a self-published author of many non-fiction books, those kinds of sales were not common. So, I was like, “Hmmmm, this romance writing thing may have something to it. And, the books don’t have to be updated like non-fiction.”\\n\\nSo I was eager to try my hand at romance writing.\\n\\nNow remember, I’d never written non-fiction before – ever. It didn’t even occur to me that I could; nor did I have a burning desire to do so. But, I was intrigued and I thought, “If she can do it, so can I.” So I wrote my first one within a couple of weeks of witnessing my sister’s success. This was in March of 2013.\\n\\nI had no idea about how to go about writing a romance novel, so I literally sat down and googled “How to Write a Romance Novel.” I clicked on that linked-to post because it had “First” in the headline, ie, “How to Write Your First Romance Novel.”\\n\\nIt was just what I needed, because I had no idea what the heck I was doing. That outline was a lifesaver; it told me exactly what to do. I followed it to the letter and 28,000+ words later, I’d seamlessly written my first love story.\\n\\n \\nWriting My First Romance Novel: Sales Results\\n\\nI excitedly uploaded it. When I got the email from Amazon that it had been published and was available for purchase less than 24 hours later, I couldn’t sit still. I had ants in my pants waiting for the sales to start rolling in.\\n\\nBut they didn’t. I kept refreshing my screen. Nothing. I looked for it on Amazon and clicked on the link to make sure that nothing technical was going on. Oh, it was there, but apparently the only person clicking on it was me – and the six loyal souls who bought copies that first month.\\n\\nYep, in my first month, I sold six copies of my romance novel. I was crushed. I thought it was a pretty good story. Sure, my sister has always been a better writer than me, but my story wasn’t that bad, was it?\\n\\n“Oh well,” I thought, “I gave it a shot.” I turned my energies back to writing non-fiction, which had provided over half my income as a freelance writer since 2010. So although romance didn’t work out, I was still making a living writing and self-publishing my own books. I thought that was the end of that.\\n\\nThen, my sister said something that resonated; she said something like, “Maybe you should try writing interracial romance. Maybe that had something to do with your lack of sales.”\\n\\nYou see, my first romance novella had been an African American love story; my sister had written an interracial romance. But I thought, “Love is love; I can’t see it making that much of a difference.”': 515,\n",

       " \"Lately, there's been a curiously increasing problem for people living in California. When they try to order certain products online, they're finding that the retailer won't ship to them, simply because of where they live. The cause boils down to legislation that dates back to a time before online retail, but is being more heavily enforced today. \\n\\nIt's called The Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, or more succinctly put, California Proposition 65. Some confuse the law as a ban on products but that's not what it is at all. Simply put, it requires companies to list warnings on products that contain certain chemicals or substances that that state has determined to be cancer or birth defect-causing agents. It's been a contentious law, to say the least, and it's a long list, currently up to 22 pages. It's not that the these substances will cause these problems with certainty, especially not in the trace amounts that those products may contain, just they have the potential.\\n\\nIt's not an easy subject to understand but it's also not a new law, so why it cause new problems? Part of it has to do with a deadline. The list of substances was amended and updated in August 2016 and now contains stricter language regarding warning labels. Manufacturers were given two-years to comply with the new labeling requirements and so, as of August 30th of this year, if they were not compliant, they could not ship or sell products into California, either on their own or through retail.\\n\\nThis presents a problem for some of the bigger retailers that source products from overseas manufacturers that are either ignorant of the law or don't want to comply with it. Enforcing warning labels is tricky business. It can cause undue fear in consumers and if only one state is demanding it, manufacturers still have to apply the label to all inventory to remain cost effective on the assembly line. That could be a public relations problem for some.\": 597,\n",

In contrast, eBay's revenue totaled just $10.07 billion, with an increase of 6.6% from 2017. Over the past three years, Amazon has significantly outpaced eBay in revenue growth with average annual revenue growth of 25.97% versus 2.86% for eBay.\\n\\nProfitability\\n\\nAs expected, Amazon also has higher net income at $300 million for the trailing 12 months versus -$147 million for eBay. Both companies have seen some challenges in direct and indirect costs affecting gross margin and operating margin metrics. Through August 31, 2018, Amazon is reporting a five-year gross margin average of 20% compared to 74% for eBay. Meanwhile, five-year average operating margin levels are 1.74% and 23.16%, respectively for Amazon and eBay. Despite the margin outperformance from eBay, Amazon has still outpaced eBay in net income growth with a trailing 12-month growth rate of 27.92% for Amazon versus no net income growth for eBay.\\n\\nValuation Metrics\\n\\nValuation metrics such as the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio and price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio essentially show which company's stock has earned a greater value from investors. In 2018, Amazon’s P/S ratio stood at 4.76, whereas eBay's was 3. 33. In 2018, Amazon’s forward P/E ratio is much higher than eBay’s at 72.99 versus 12.72 for eBay. Among the FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google). Amazon’s P/E is second to Netflix with a P/E of 85.74. Amazon also falls in the top quartile of this group while eBay is in the bottom quartile with a group average of 38.36. Based on forward P/E valuation alone, Amazon is the favored investment.\\n\\nActive User Base\\n\\nAccording to data from Statista, Amazon was the most popular e-commerce marketplace as of December 2017 with 197 million users per month. eBay however, was Amazon’s third-closest rival with approximately 113 million unique monthly visitors. Other high traffic competitor sites include Craigslist, Etsy, Walmart, and Overstock.\\n\\nSeller Rating\\n\\nSeller rating is a conglomeration of consumer opinions on seller profitability, customer service, communication, ease of use and recommendation with a leading measurement reported by Ecommercebytes Sellers Choice. As of 2018, the EcommerceBytes Sellers Choice report showed Amazon and eBay with the top two rankings at 6.23 and 6.18 respectively.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line\\n\\nAmazon by far is the bigger corporation, dwarfing eBay in sales and income. Amazon has a significantly higher forward P/E showing greater room for growth. As of September 2018, Amazon was trading at $2,002,90 versus $33.02 for eBay. Amazon has been making investments to become the world’s top e-commerce marketplace and retailer. Its potential is substantially outpacing other specialty e-commerce marketplaces such as Etsy and Overstock. Amazon is also a top investment in comparison to the FAANG stocks, which adds greater credibility to Amazon’s investment opportunity given the valuation metrics of the FAANG group as well.\\n\": 976,\n",
