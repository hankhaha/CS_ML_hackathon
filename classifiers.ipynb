The shopping cart feature is really only designed for physical items.  It helps Amazon keep costs down by shipping them together in one order, especially with Prime members, who get free shipping. As there’s no such savings for them with electronic items, there’s really no reason to group them.                                        \n",

They received an item in perfect condition, NOT DAMAGED Awesome. You did a great job packing up the item.   2.  Reason for Return Given: No Longer Needed Hence, withhold shipping both ways.   3.  I doubt the item they returned was ours originally Since you “doubt” it, you are not 100% certain.   4.  I received back an item very different from what they received. Since you are not certain that it was not the same, I am assuming you mean it came back in a different condition than you sent it in.   5.  The Holiday and regular return policy requires the Buyer to return the item in the same condition it was received. Since it was not returned in the same condition it was sent in, Amazon will allow you to asses up to a 50% restocking fee.   So, once again… All you can do in this instance is withhold shipping both ways and assess a 50% restocking fee.  Welcome to selling on Amazon.   \n",

Perhaps it's a sweater you’ll never wear, a kitchen appliance that will never see the light of day, or a home decoration that doesn't work in your space. When this happens with Amazon purchases, customers can easily return the item(s) in favor of finding an item that does work for them.  After a customer returns a package to Amazon, it is received at one of our many fulfillment centers. An Amazon associate removes the item from the packaging and inspects it to determine whether the item can be sold.

Adaptive immunity creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen, leads to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that pathogen.This process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination.Like the innate system, the adaptive system includes both humoral immunity components and cell-mediated immunity components. Unlike the innate immune system, the adaptive immune system is highly specific to a specific pathogen.he adaptive system response destroys invading pathogens and any toxic molecules they produce. Sometimes the adaptive system is unable to distinguish foreign molecules, the effects of this may be hayfever, asthma or any other allergies. Antigens are any substances that elicit the adaptive immune response.</td>\n",

       "26394  1. The shipper just used basic ground and they have 6-12 days to deliver it.  2. You had it shipped days before a major holiday so you competing with a million FruitCakes and Turdukens for your package priority.  3. Bad delivery drivers, mostly fedex, tend to mark your package as delivered or out for delivery and just throw it in the back of the truck till they get to your run next week. I've had FedEx mark a package as delivered on Tue. then show up Fri night at 9:30pm to actually deliver it.   As for the way the logistics work FedEx, UPS, and USPS all use the same planes so if it needs to take a plane ride sometimes it has to go as close as it can get, then take a truck the rest of the way. Now if it goes by truck all the way you just gotta wait it out as it goes from hub to hub. Whats ironic is that I can mail a priority package from FL to CA and it will arrive by plane in 2-3 days. Now if I ship a package from Miami FL to Gainsville FL it takes a truck the whole way and will take 3-4 days for delivery.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "47503  The adaptive immune system is one of the two main immunity strategies found in vertebrates (the other being the innate immune system). Adaptive immunity creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen, leads to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that pathogen.This process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination.Like the innate system, the adaptive system includes both humoral immunity components and cell-mediated immunity components. Unlike the innate immune system, the adaptive immune system is highly specific to a specific pathogen.he adaptive system response destroys invading pathogens and any toxic molecules they produce. Sometimes the adaptive system is unable to distinguish foreign molecules, the effects of this may be hayfever, asthma or any other allergies. Antigens are any substances that elicit the adaptive immune response.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

A new start-up company is gambling that online shoppers who are worried about not getting their packages will be willing to pay extra to ship them to a home-based network of package receivers in Brooklyn.  With online shopping surging and another holiday season unfolding, customers’ mounting frustration and anger over stolen packages are driving many to take creative and even extreme measures to keep items out of the hands of thieves.  In New York City, where more orders are delivered than anywhere else in the country, over 90,000 packages a day are stolen or disappear without explanation, up roughly 20 percent from four years ago, according to an analysis conducted for The New York Times.  About 15 percent of all deliveries in urban areas fail to reach customers on the first attempt because of package theft and other issues, like deliveries to the wrong house, according to transportation experts.</td>\n",

I’ve sent email to that address multiple times and never received any reply. Is there any other way to get it reactivate it?  Thanks  :thinking: Did you email that account from the email address that’s associated with the deactivated account? If so, I would try emailing from a different email address.  Additionally, because you are able to post here, I suspect that you are able to log in to Seller Central.

You can use the shortcut here:  Phone Support and Seller Help - Creating Cases  - Help and Contact us changes once again (updated) url.  I’ve sent email from my other email account. Yet no reply either.  Still no reply. What should I do?  Did you open a case with Seller Support, too?  Yes. I have 3 cases open. But there is no way to track them and there is no response of any kind.  Surprising you’re making these efforts to sell a couple of books, and your account is blocked but you claim not to know why.

       "52356   Online deliveries to an apartment building in northern Manhattan are left with a retired woman in 2H who watches over her neighbors’ packages to make sure nothing gets stolen.  Corporate mailrooms in New York and other cities are overwhelmed by employees shipping personal packages to work for safekeeping, leading companies to ban packages and issue warnings that boxes will be intercepted and returned to the senders.  A new start-up company is gambling that online shoppers who are worried about not getting their packages will be willing to pay extra to ship them to a home-based network of package receivers in Brooklyn.  With online shopping surging and another holiday season unfolding, customers’ mounting frustration and anger over stolen packages are driving many to take creative and even extreme measures to keep items out of the hands of thieves.  In New York City, where more orders are delivered than anywhere else in the country, over 90,000 packages a day are stolen or disappear without explanation, up roughly 20 percent from four years ago, according to an analysis conducted for The New York Times.  About 15 percent of all deliveries in urban areas fail to reach customers on the first attempt because of package theft and other issues, like deliveries to the wrong house, according to transportation experts.    \n",

       "25492   Enzymes are biological catalysts. Catalysts lower the activation energy for reactions. The lower the activation energy for a reaction, the faster the rate. Thus enzymes speed up reactions by lowering activation energy. Many enzymes change shape when substrates bind. This is termed induced fit, meaning that the precise orientation of the enzyme required for catalytic activity can be induced by the binding of the substrate. Enzymes have active sites.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "5433    Is it loud enough for a small house party   The Echo is certainly loud enough to beam music across a large room or adjoining rooms for a small party. I use it all the time to play music in my kitchen and connected family room. Keep in mind a) it's won't be stereo and b) its a small speaker with limited audio fidelity but if you're looking for good quality that will fill the room it should work just fine.

       "37774   Hi,  I’d to list a couple of books for sale ( 10). I have a buyer account and I tried to list them. I got the message  This email address is associated with a deactivated seller account. Please contact seller-performance@amazon.com to request reactivation of your account.  I’ve sent email to that address multiple times and never received any reply. Is there any other way to get it reactivate it?  Thanks  :thinking: Did you email that account from the email address that’s associated with the deactivated account? If so, I would try emailing from a different email address.  Additionally, because you are able to post here, I suspect that you are able to log in to Seller Central. You should be able to open a case with Seller Support (copy the message you received into it). You can use the shortcut here:  Phone Support and Seller Help - Creating Cases  - Help and Contact us changes once again (updated) url.  I’ve sent email from my other email account. Yet no reply either.  Still no reply. What should I do?  Did you open a case with Seller Support, too?  Yes. I have 3 cases open. But there is no way to track them and there is no response of any kind.  Surprising you’re making these efforts to sell a couple of books, and your account is blocked but you claim not to know why. It looks you’re probably up to no good.       \n",
